# BigchainDB Roadmap

Below is a sketch of some of the things we plan to do in upcoming releases of BigchainDB Server (and associated software), i.e. in the near term. It is, of course, subject to change. If you don't see an important feature listed here, please read about how to request a feature in our docs on [Contributing to BigchainDB](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/contributing/en/latest/index.html).

## BigchainDB 2.0

The main change in BigchainDB 2.0 (from 1.3) is that consensus, replication and sync are done using Tendermint. That means that [BigchainDB 2.0 is Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)](https://blog.bigchaindb.com/bigchaindb-2-0-is-byzantine-fault-tolerant-5ffdac96bc44).

Starting with BigchainDB 2.0, we commit to making it possible to migrate to the next version without loss of data. We will provide documentation and tools to help with migration. This is needed by users who are going into production.

### Done in BigchainDB 2.0 Alpha, Released on April 3, 2018

1. Finish HTTP API changes
1. Simplify & automate the production deployment process
1. Consolidate the proposal system (especially COSS)
1. Change the allowed transaction version number from "1.0" to "2.0"
1. Update the official drivers (Python driver & JavaScript driver)
1. BigchainDB Server CLI updates (not the client-side CLI: deprecate that)
1. Compute an app hash for Tendermint (in a dumb way _that works_).
1. Standard process to set up a local node for development & testing, using Docker Compose.
1. Set up a network for the AE team to do some performance tests.
1. New `bigchaindb upsert-validator` subcommand to add/change/remove a validator at run time, "insecure" way.
1. The Events API ane Events Plugin API: update code & docs.

### Done in BigchainDB 2.0 Alpha 2, Released on April 18, 2018

1. Implement [BEP-8](https://github.com/bigchaindb/BEPs/tree/master/8).
1. Provide more informative HTTP responses when posting transactions.

### Done in BigchainDB 2.0 Alpha 3, Released on May 3, 2018

1. Fix all priority-0 bugs, such as [issue #2182](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/2182).
1. Integrate the latest verson of Tendermint. This means upgrading the ABCI server software used by BigchainDB (py-abci).
1. In our production deployment template, combine Tendermint and BigchainDB inside _one_ Kubernetes StatefulSet (a kind of pod, one with persistent state).
1. Documentation about how a node operator can expose the full power of MongoDB to users.

### Done in BigchainDB 2.0 Beta 1, Released on June 1, 2018

1. Have a second, internal test network, where each node is operated by a different BigchainDB employee.
1. Update the Ansible & Vagrant deployment tooling.
1. Remove some dead code, e.g. the code for RethinkDB support, and the "pipelines" code.

### Goals for the Final Stable Release of BigchainDB 2.0

There's a loose collection of BigchainDB 2.0 "TODO" items in the GitHub organization project board named [BigchainDB 2.0 TODO](https://github.com/orgs/bigchaindb/projects/5)

1. Publish all testing software and test results, including integration tests, performance tests (benchmarks), and stress tests.
1. Migration to future versions should be _possible_. See the explanation of what that means in the first paragraph of this section.
1. Implementation of a [clean shutdown procedure (for BigchainDB)](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/projects/7). This is a blocker for the next item...
1. BigchainDB and Tendermint packaged as a single service unit. (This is [issue #2238](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/2238).)
1. The test networks have run without issue for weeks.
1. Make changes to keep up with changes in Tendermint before the release of Tendermint 1.0. See https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1568
1. Tendermint 1.0 has been released. One can check that on the [Cosmos Roadmap page](https://cosmos.network/roadmap).
1. Known causes of failure (e.g. DDoS attacks) are documented.
1. Updates to the BigchainDB Server configuration settings: remove some settings (keys) and maybe add some Tendermint-related settings. This should be done once we merge pull request https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2342
1. Most of the old defunct code is removed.

Other things that might be done for the 2.0 release include:

- Increased code test coverage on the Events API.
- All (or most) tests are running on Travis CI.

## Some Goals for BigchainDB 2.1 and Beyond

- Example projects showing how to use BigchainDB with other decentralized systems, especially Ethereum.
- Refactoring, especially of the transaction-related code.
- New way to compute the app hash based on the UTXO set, including an efficient way to update the Merkle tree used to compute the app hash from the UTXO set.
- No more 3scale (currently used by the BigchainDB Testnet)
- Support hashlock conditions (securely: need to make sure that every transaction is still signed by a client)
- Support timelock conditions
- (?) LevelDB vs other backends in Tendermint?
- Plugins/extensions for specialized use cases
- Smart contract support. (Not necessarily within BigchainDB; maybe just better documentation about how to integrate with other smart-contract blockchains.)
- Test what happens when a node runs out of memory or hard drive space. For example, what happens when there's no more space for MongoDB to write a block?

## BigchainDB 3.0?

- Make it possible to run a public BigchainDB network where anyone can add a node (without permission).
