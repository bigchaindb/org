# BigchainDB Roadmap

As of October 2018, [governance of the BigchainDB software began transitioning](https://blog.bigchaindb.com/the-next-evolution-for-bigchaindb-software-a104185a8763) from BigchainDB GmbH to the [IPDB Foundation](https://ipdb.io/). That includes defining the roadmap. If you'd like to be involved with that, then contact the IPDB Foundation.

[BigchainDB 2.0.0b7](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/releases/tag/v2.0.0b7) was released on September 28, 2018.

The only thing that _must_ be done before the release of BigchainDB 2.0.0 (with no beta) is to update it to work with Tendermint 1.0.

Old files, including the old `ROADMAP.md` file, can be found in the `archive` folder.
