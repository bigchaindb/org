### 2. Commit and reveal
A group emerged from the last commit and reveal:
- Tim + Sylvain + Shahbaz: spec out some ideas on open source software governance

Actionables from other team members:
- Alberto: let's practice to talk about **problems** instead of **features**
- Jerry: visual representation of dashboard, doing a simple PoC on how to display transactions


### 3. Problem with transaction malleability
After planning, a smaller group (Troy, Sylvain, Alberto, Manolo, Vanshdeep) gathered to discuss that problem.

Currently, the transaction id (hash) doesn't include the fulfillments. To solve this, we need to fulfill first and then calculate the hash.

We had a discussion on how to manage the version of the transaction model and of BigchainDB server. Since this change in the transaction model is **not** backward compatible, some of us thinks we should release BigchainDB 2.0, others think BigchainDB 1.x should handle different versions of the transaction model.

Considering the time constraints, we decided for the following:
- Create a new version of the Transaction model (namely `2.0`)
- Treat the problem as a security issue and address it immediately ([most of the work](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1899) has already been done by Sylvain).
- Immediately contact the developers of the Ruby and Java driver, and work with them to fix the issue on their side.
- Change the HTTP API to immediately reject `1.0` transactions and give an **informative error** like "BigchainDB doesn't accept v1.0 txs anymore because security, please update your driver"
