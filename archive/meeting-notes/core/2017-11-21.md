# Core meeting, Nov 21st 2017

## Agenda
Christmas comes early this year, and it's called "planning for Tendermint, Round 2".

Given that we are almost done with Round 1, I want you to come up with the problems we want to solve for Round 2. I can start telling you what problems in my opinion are valuable to solve:
- be compatible with the original BigchainDB 1.x HTTP API
- how do we keep docs up to date?
- verify that our community can actually use BigchainDB 2.0
  - deploy BigchainDB 2.0 to test.ipdb.io
  - ask our community to install and try BigchainDB 2.0

This is open to discussion, your homework for tomorrow is to come to the meeting with problems you want to see solved for Round 2. Together we will prioritize problems, and eventually put some of them in "Round 3".

But come prepared! The more prepared you are the less time we spend in the meeting blocking each other. Come with a defined list of problems. One problem, two, ten problemsâ€”but not too much stuff, you don't want to monopolize and centralize the discussion around you :D


## Notes
Leftovers from Round 1:
- merge [add tests to improve codecov](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1871)
- merge [Integrate api GET "/transactions?asset_id=&operation="](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1864)
- merge [Moved class "Block" to namedtuple](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1862)
- merge [Write transfer test](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1863)
- merge [Docker compose tendermint](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1859)
- merge PR for bash script

Things to solve for Round 2:
- Alb (+Troy): Keep documentation up to date. Solutions: iterate over the TOC, write an issue around that and ask Troy to review it.
- Mua+Sha: running a testnet on azure
- Sha: having our community try bigchaindb + tendermint using a bootstrap script
- Van+Katha: porting the HTTP API to the new code + test
- Syl: investigate [implement app hash as merkle root of utxo](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/1865)
- Alb+Mua: how to setup a federation?

Open problems:
- How do we port legacy tests?
- How do we clean up legacy code?
- Should we run multiple nodes in CI? or just a single node? distinction between unit tests (they can run on our CI travis), and integration tests (multiple nodes, I guess at least 4, running test scenarios...)
- Investigate how much does it take to have a BigchainDB [light client](https://blog.cosmos.network/light-clients-in-tendermint-consensus-1237cfbda104)
